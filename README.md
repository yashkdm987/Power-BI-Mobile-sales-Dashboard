The project aims to help business teams track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit margins, quantity sold, and regional growth trends.

This dashboard offers an interactive and visually appealing interface that enables users to:

- Monitor overall sales performance and revenue trends

- Compare brand-wise and category-wise sales data
